<h3> LeapSV: Gesture Controlled Street View Explorer </h3>

LeapSV is a control system for Google Street View. Leap Motion is used to allow a user to control movement and speed in Street View, in the driving mode provided by the Google Street View API. LeapSV plays a hyper-lapse video of a route between the specified points on Google Maps, and the user is able to pan, slow, stop and speed up during the hyperlapse. 

<h4> Platform Details </h4>

The app was built and tested using Google Chrome Version 42.0.2311.135 (64-bit) on OSX Yosemite 10.10.2. For the best user experience, use the most recent version of Google Chrome on OSX. The application should perform just fine on other operating systems with an up-to-date version of Google Chrome.

<h4> Instructions </h4>

Go to https://web.mit.edu/birkanu/www/finalProject/ (make sure https is used since it does not continously ask you if you want to allow using your microphone) to run the application. The speech recognition on this page won't work locally because of the Web Speech API. Once the start and the end locations are entered and the "HYPERLAPSE" command is given, you will be directed to the hyperlapse page. A warning will appear on the browser input field saying that "This page is trying to load scripts from unauthenticated sources". Please click on "Load unsafe scripts" to be able to use your Leap Motion and have LeapSV generate the hyperlapse video. Image below shows where to click on:
